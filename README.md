# TNP
 This is a full stack clone website of Training&PlacementCell(TNP), GNDEC. I am using  React js library for frontend development and for styling raw CSS and bootstrap library, Node js library for Backend development and Mysql Database for the data management.  

 I have used json server npm package to make my restapi so first we create a json-server then restapi is created then we run our react app.
 Disclaimer-Both the servers should be running on different ports.
